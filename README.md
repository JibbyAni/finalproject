Synopsis

In this project I implement a distributed application that allows a Carnegie Mellon student to input the courses that they are taking and share that with other people. Potentially this will allow for people other than administrators to see your course schedule and any time it updates they can have a link for your schedule. This utilizes the Scotty Labs Course API:  https://github.com/ScottyLabs/course-api

Motivation

This project was created from an assignment from the Carnegie Mellon undergraduate course Mobile to Cloud: Distributed Applications

Installation
