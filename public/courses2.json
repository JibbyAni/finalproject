Models for population growth, global food production, and global water resources are then presented, and current problems such as land use, urbanization, and energy and material resources are discussed. Models of industry based on life sciences are then explored, and tools for sustainable engineering are presented. These tools include metrics of sustainability, principles of design for the environment, methods for pollution prevention, and use of mass and energy balances in the design of sustainable systems.
