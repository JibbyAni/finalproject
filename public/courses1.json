Do all aspects of syntax manipulate the same kinds of structural units, or do different grammatical processes rest on incompatible notions of constituency? How do other syntactic relations connect with constituent structure? To the extent that there is mismatch between different notions of syntactic structure, how can it be reconciled within a theory of grammar?

What does the medium in which a text is presented?the book, or film, or painting, or theatrical performance?have to do with how the text is received, consumed, contested, or appropriated, sometimes or often against the intentions of the author, painter, or performer? This course studies the long-debated problem of how readers or spectators respond to texts (in print, film, theater or painting) from ancient rhetoric and tragedy to contemporary mass culture. Aristotle, Plato, Longinus and other ancients theorized about audience response in terms of its danger or advantage to the polis; in that broad sense, the problem has always been political as well as psychological and aesthetic. Eighteenth-century thinkers formulated notions of 'beauty' and 'standards of taste' to measure audience response to poetry and visual art. Romantic writers developed psychologies of reading as symbolic interpretation. The rise of mass culture, on the other hand, links the politics of reading or viewing to questions of consumption and the market of cultural goods. Guided by recent critical theory as well as classic questions, we will ask how the reading or viewing subject is 'constructed' by the printed or filmic text; how institutions like schools control the process of interpretation; how individual readers 'appropriate' texts for themselves against their authors? intentions.

Students in this course will work in partnerships to explore novel methods of robotic metal sheet forming that are borne out of direct experimentation with industrial robotic arms and customized metal forming tools. We will operate in response to two primary motivations: 1. Explore novel methods of customizable robotic metal sheet forming. 2. Speculate upon the potential application of the results at the building scale. Our work will leverage the robustness and precision of industrial robotic arms in conjunction with rule-based, computationally generated geometry to explore highly customizable alternatives to long-standing massproduction metal forming techniques. In situating this as an open-ended series of design experiments, rather than product designs, we seek to produce artifacts that reveal the methods of their production and uniqueness of their material character, while suggesting potential applications at the building scale."}, "39310": {"department": "CIT Interdisciplinary", "lectures": [{"instructors": ["Jacobson", "Larsen", "Kissel", "Bonime", "Shukla"], "sections": [], "lecture": "A", "meetings": [{"room": "DNM DNM", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "end": null, "days": "TBA", "begin": null}]}], "name": "Experiential Learning III", "units": 0.0, "prereqs": "39-220", "semester": ["F", "S"], "coreqs": "", "desc": "The engineer of the 21st century will need to operate effectively in many settings and often with a global perspective.

These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the interwar period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships, and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and certain controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larra\u00edn 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. Three main questions will be discussed throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?, How does Latin America think of itself?, What does Latin America want to be?.

We also analyze the efficiency and welfare properties of such outcomes, paying special attention to the role of policy in influencing market outcomes. We consider how policy can address the efficiency and welfare shortcomings of markets that may result from informational asymmetries, industrial organization, moral hazard, transactions costs, and bounded rationality.

Collaboration and integration of design, media and storytelling is critical to this approach. Experimentation with new forms can reanimate the basic values of theater; the essential nature of a live event, the possibility of visionary spectacle, and the creation of meaning in dialogue with an audience.

While simple enough, the definition suggests a concern with concentrated form and unified artistic effect. in a sense, the short story has been around as long as people have been telling each other tales, to be sure, but as a literary form it came into its own in modern times, during the 19th century and it continues to be produced in considerable numbers. For many readers one of the great features is the one Poe pointed to: it is short. People who have never finished a novel by Henry James must be legion. So we can experience something with genuine literary merit, in an accessible form. Concentration, of course, can bring issues of comprehension and often short stories can seem puzzling or incomplete to the average reader. This class will attempt to develop our abilities to read with care and attention\u2014and feeling\u2014in order to make us better readers of any artistic text.

This phenomenon occurred in part because of the development of mass media, including popular books and magazines, movies, and recordings. These media provided both objects with which adolescents identified and hence defined themselves, and representations of the activities of youth to the rest of the population. This course will focus on films which have since the twenties performed these functions. It will pay particular attention to post-W. W. II youth subcultures in the United States and Britain such as the student-radical subculture or punk subculture. We will also look at the representations that the mass media have created of youth: from the \"flaming youth\" of the twenties to the juvenile delinquents of the fifties. While both movies and records are art forms, they are also commodities. They are products of what Adorno calls the \"culture industry.\" In the 1950s, youth becomes a specific market for which a host of special products are created. These include genres of both movies and records, but also clothes, food, toothpaste. etc. While earlier products of large film studios and record companies aimed at the widest possible audience and tended to openly reflect mainstream values, the movies and records designed for teenagers tried explicitly to appeal to the values of a presumed youth subculture. Perhaps as a result\u2014or perhaps for other reasons\u2014some of these materials appear to be subversive of the dominant culture. A major question which this course will try to answer is whether youth culture has in fact been generally, or even occasionally, subversive, or whether it has served mainly to reinforce the dominant ideology.

Second, to expand their ability to knowledgeably critique individual cinematic works and the relationship of those works to the larger culture.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own. The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community. Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach.
